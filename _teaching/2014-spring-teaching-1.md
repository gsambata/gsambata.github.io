At the end of this module, students should be familiar with the main classes of partial differential equations; be familiar with the fundamental mathematical concepts needed to analysis and solve partial differential equations, in particular the leading theories of 21st century analysis, such as measure theory and distribution theory; be able to use the essential methods for solving partial differential equations (characteristic methods, series decomposition or Fourier transform); be able to implement these methods numerically for solving partial differential equations using algorithms implemented in the Python language.
