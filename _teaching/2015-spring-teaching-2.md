The primary aim of the module is to present the key concepts of object-oriented programming and to illustrate these concepts, which are largely independent of the programming language, using the Python language. The module therefore follows on from the teaching of procedural Python in preparatory classes.
The second objective of the module is to show how object-oriented programming can be used to produce higher-quality code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. To achieve this, the basic aspects of modeling are covered, i.e. the techniques, practices, and notation that enable the description of a problem in natural language to be translated into a program.<br />
These two complementary objectives should enable students to be effective in writing and developing Python programs, so that the programming aspects do not cause difficulties or slow down other modules.
