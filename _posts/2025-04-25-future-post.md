I am happy to announce that I received funding through the [SIAM Postdoctoral Support Program](https://www.siam.org/programs-initiatives/programs/siam-postdoctoral-support-program/).

For two years starting from May 1st, 2025, I will be mentored by [Dr. Irina Tezaur](https://www.sandia.gov/-ikalash/staff/irina-tezaur/), Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California. 

Our goal is to develop model order reduction methods that enable efficient and reliable solutions to pressing environmental challenges.
