I am happy to announce that I received funding through the [SIAM C.H. Robinson Postdoctoral Support Program](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-news/articles/congratulations-to-the-2025-siam-postdoctoral-support-program-recipients/).

I will be mentored by [Dr. Irina Tezaur](https://www.sandia.gov/-ikalash/staff/irina-tezaur/), Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California. 
Our goal is to develop model order reduction methods that enable efficient and reliable solutions to pressing environmental challenges.
