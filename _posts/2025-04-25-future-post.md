I received funding through the [SIAM Postdoctoral Support Program](https://www.siam.org/programs-initiatives/programs/siam-postdoctoral-support-program/).

For two years starting from May 1st, 2025, I will be mentored by Dr. Irina Tezaur, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California. 

Our goal is to develop model order reduction methods that enable efficient and reliable solutions to pressing environmental challenges.
