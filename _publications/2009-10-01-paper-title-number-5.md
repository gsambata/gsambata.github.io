### Abstract <br>
The objective of the thesis is to develop a component-based model order reduction
procedure for a class of problems in nonlinear mechanics with internal variables. The
work is is motivated by applications to thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) systems for
radioactive waste disposal (this project is funded by ANDRA, the national agency for
radioactive waste management). THM equations model the behaviour of temperature,
pore water pressure and solid displacement in the neighborhood of geological reposito-
ries, which contain radioactive waste and are responsible for a significant thermal flux
towards the Earthâ€™s surface. From a mathematical point of view, the THM system
that we solve is a time-dependent and highly nonlinear coupled system; furthermore,
the solution to the problem depends on several parameters, which might be related to
the geometric configuration (e.g. the number of repositories, their distance or their
size) or the material properties of the medium. For example, changes in the position
and/or the number of the radioactive repositories might lead to significant changes in
the predicted quantities of interest; we would need therefore to solve the numerical
model more than once. This problem represents a multi-query problem and it requires
the application of component-based parametrized model order reduction (CB-pMOR).
First, we start from the high-fidelity finite element discretisation of the two-dimensional
THM problem, we develop a monolithic projection-based ROM and we study its per-
formance with respect to predictions. Then, we device a CB-pMOR formulation for
steady problems in nonlinear mechanics. Finally, we extend the CB formulation and
methodology to time-dependent nonlinear problems with internal variables, to tackle
the THM problem of interest.
