### Abstract <br>
We propose a projection-based monolithic model order reduction (MOR) procedure for a class of problems
in nonlinear mechanics with internal variables. The work is is motivated by applications to thermo-hydro-
mechanical (THM) systems for radioactive waste disposal. THM equations model the behaviour of tem-
perature, pore water pressure and solid displacement in the neighborhood of geological repositories, which
contain radioactive waste and are responsible for a significant thermal flux towards the Earthâ€™s surface. We
develop an adaptive sampling strategy based on the POD-Greedy method, and we develop an element-wise
empirical quadrature hyper-reduction procedure to reduce assembling costs. We present numerical results
for a two-dimensional THM system to illustrate and validate the proposed methodology.
