### Abstract <br>
In this work we consider the optimized Schwarz method designed for computational
domains that feature spherical or almost spherical interfaces. In the first part, we consider the
diffusion-reaction problem. We provide a convergence analysis of the generalized Schwarz method
and, following [G. Gigante and C. Vergara, Numer. Math., 131 (2015), pp. 369–404], we discuss an
optimization procedure for constant interface parameters leading to a Robin–Robin scheme. Finally,
we present some numerical results both in spherical and in ellipsoidal domains. In the second part
of the work, we address the fluid-structure interaction problem. Again, we provide a convergence
analysis and discuss optimized choices of constant interface parameters. Finally, we present three-
dimensional numerical results inspired by hemodynamic applications, to validate the proposed choices
in the presence of large added mass effect. In particular, we consider numerical experiments both in
an ideal spherical domain and in a realistic abdominal aortic aneurysm.
