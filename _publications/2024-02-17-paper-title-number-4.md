### Abstract <br>
In this work we develop a component-based model order reduction (CB-pMOR)
procedure for a class of problems in nonlinear mechanics with internal variables. The work is
motivated by applications to thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) systems for radioactive waste
disposal. The THM system is coupled, time-dependent, and highly nonlinear; furthermore,
the solution to the problem depends on several parameters, which might be related to the
geometric configuration (e.g. the number of repositories, their distance or their size) or the
material properties of the medium. We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
terms of accuracy and computational costs for a two-dimensional THM system in the case of
overlapping partitions.

**Key words.**  Model order reduction; Domain decomposition; Coupled problems.
