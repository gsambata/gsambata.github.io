I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Applied Mathematics at FAU, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität, Erlangen (Germany), where I collaborate with Prof. E. Zuazua.\
Before, I got a PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Bordeaux, France and I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, Marne La Vallée, France.

## Summary of research activities

The application that motivated **my doctoral thesis** is the storage of high-level radioactive waste in geological environments.  
The work is driven by applications to thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) systems---I collaborated with [Andra](https://www.andra.fr)
--- the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management.

Possiamo anche scrivere una formula inline, come \( E = mc^2 \), per rappresentare la famosa equazione di Einstein sulla relatività.
