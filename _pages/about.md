I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Applied Mathematics at FAU, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität, Erlangen (Germany), where I collaborate with Prof. E. Zuazua.
Before, I got a PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Bordeaux, France and I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, Marne La Vallée, France.

## PhD project

### Motivation
The application motivating my Phd thesis is the disposal and storage of high-level radioactive waste materials in geological media. I collaborated with Andra, — the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management. To protect the environment from the radioactive emission, the radioactive waste is disposed in packages that are located horizontally deep underground (at approximately 300 to 500 meters) and are monitored until their radioactivity has decayed to an acceptable level. Figure 1 is a schematic representatin of waste disposal in the repositories. Due to the large temperature of the radioactive waste, a thermal flux is generated inside the alveoli: the thermal flux then drives the mechanical and hydraulic response of the geological medium over the course of several years.

This phenomenon requires a careful assessment of the long-term effects on neighboring areas.

### The THM problem

From a mathematical viewpoint, the system behaviour is described by time-dependent large scale coupled systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) called Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) systems: they model the behaviour of temperature, pore water pressure and solid displacement in the neighborhood of geological repositories. To introduce the mathematical formulation, we consider the spatial variable x in the Lipschitz domain$\Omega$
